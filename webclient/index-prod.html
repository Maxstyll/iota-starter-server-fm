   Data Privacy Disclaimer
   
   This Program has been developed for demonstration purposes only to illustrate the technical
   capabilities and potential business uses of the IBM IoT for Automotive
   
   The components included in this Program may involve the processing of personal information
   (for example location tracking and behavior analytics). When implemented in practice such
   processing may be subject to specific legal and regulatory requirements imposed by country
   specific data protection and privacy laws. Any such requirements are not addressed in
   this Program.
   
   Licensee is responsible for the ensuring Licensee's use of this Program and any deployed
   solution meets applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This may require the implementation
   of additional features and functions not included in the Program.
   
   Apple License issue
   
   This Program is intended solely for use with an Apple iOS product and intended to be used
   in conjunction with officially licensed Apple development tools and further customized
   and distributed under the terms and conditions of Licensee's licensed Apple iOS Developer
   Program or Licensee's licensed Apple iOS Enterprise Program.
   
   Licensee agrees to use the Program to customize and build the application for Licensee's own
   purpose and distribute in accordance with the terms of Licensee's Apple developer program
   
   Risk Mitigation / Product Liability Issues
   
   The Program and any resulting application is not intended for design, construction, control,
   or maintenance of automotive control systems where failure of such sample code or resulting
   application could give rise to a material threat of death or serious personal injury.
   
   IBM shall have no responsibility regarding the Program's or resulting application's compliance
   with laws and regulations applicable to Licensee's business and content. Licensee is responsible
   for use of the Program and any resulting application.
   
   As with any development process, Licensee is responsible for developing, sufficiently testing
   and remediating Licensee's products and applications and Licensee is solely responsible for any
   foreseen or unforeseen consequences or failures of Licensee's products or applications.
   
   REDISTRIBUTABLES
   
   If the Program includes components that are Redistributable, they will be identified 
   in the REDIST file that accompanies the Program. In addition to the license rights granted
   in the Agreement, Licensee may distribute the Redistributables subject to the following terms:
   
   1) Redistribution must be in source code form only and must conform to all directions,
      instruction and specifications in the Program's accompanying REDIST or documentation;
   2) If the Program's accompanying documentation expressly allows Licensee to modify
      the Redistributables, such modification must conform to all directions, instruction and
      specifications in that documentation and these modifications, if any, must be treated
      as Redistributables;
   3) Redistributables may be distributed only as part of Licensee's application that was developed
      using the Program ("Licensee's Application") and only to support Licensee's customers
      in connection with their use of Licensee's Application. Licensee's application must constitute
      significant value add such that the Redistributables are not a substantial motivation
      for the acquisition by end users of Licensee's software product;
   4) If the Redistributables include a Java Runtime Environment, Licensee must also include other
      non-Java Redistributables with Licensee's Application, unless the Application is designed to
      run only on general computer devices (e.g., laptops, desktops and servers) and not on handheld
      or other pervasive devices (i.e., devices that contain a microprocessor but do not have
      computing as their primary purpose);
   5) Licensee may not remove any copyright or notice files contained in the Redistributables;
   6) Licensee must hold IBM, its suppliers or distributors harmless from and against any claim
      arising out of the use or distribution of Licensee's Application;
   7) Licensee may not use the same path name as the original Redistributable files/modules;
   8) Licensee may not use IBM's, its suppliers or distributors names or trademarks in connection
      with the marketing of Licensee's Application without IBM's or that supplier's
      or distributor's prior written consent;
   9) IBM, its suppliers and distributors provide the Redistributables and related documentation
      without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
      OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.;
   10) Licensee is responsible for all technical assistance for Licensee's Application and any
       modifications to the Redistributables; and
   11) Licensee's license agreement with the end user of Licensee's Application must notify the end
       user that the Redistributables or their modifications may not be i) used for any purpose
       other than to enable Licensee's Application, ii) copied (except for backup purposes),
       iii) further distributed or transferred without Licensee's Application or 
       iv) reverse assembled, reverse compiled, or otherwise translated except as specifically
       permitted by law and without the possibility of a contractual waiver. Furthermore, Licensee's
       license agreement must be at least as protective of IBM as the terms of this Agreement.
   
   Feedback License
   
   In the event Licensee provides feedback to IBM regarding the Program, Licensee agrees to assign
   to IBM all right, title, and interest (including ownership of copyright) in any data, suggestions,
   or written materials that 1) are related to the Program and 2) that Licensee provides to IBM.
